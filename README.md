## Hi there 👋 My Name is Thomas Littleton

Welcome to my GitHub! I am an Application Development and Delivery student at Red River College Polytechnic, passionate about technology, software development, and experimenting with homelabs.

My projects are organized in repositories as follows:

- **Back-end projects** are under the `back` folder.
- **Front-end projects** are under the `front` folder.
- Projects for specific courses, like ISD and SDF, are organized accordingly.

Some personal projects, as well as other school projects, are available in the VS Code folder.

I am actively adding more projects and improving the ones already uploaded. This includes:
- Cleaning up existing projects.
- Adding documentation for each project, including instructions on how to run them locally.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to expand my portfolio!
